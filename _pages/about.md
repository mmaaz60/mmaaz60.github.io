* I previously worked for [WENN](http://wenn.no) and [VeracityAI](http://veracityai.com/) researching and building
  computer vision algorithms aimed at augmenting vehicle insurance claims processing.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk) in
  2020, where I completed my
  <a href="https://github.com/kahnchana/fyp_report/blob/master/main/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a>
  on Multi-Object Tracking and Image Segmentation under the supervision of
  [Dr. Ranga Rodrigo](http://ranga.staff.uom.lk) and [Dr Sadeep Jayasumana](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sadeep/).
* I completed a research internship at [FiveAI](https://five.ai), UK supporting their research efforts to
  building better self-driving cars under the supervision of [Dr Sadeep Jayasumana](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sadeep/),
  [Dr Vibhav Vineet](http://vibhavvineet.info), and
  [Dr Sina Samangooei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bOfKAGQAAAAJ&hl=en).

* Research Assistant at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) CV department under
  [Dr Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/) and [Dr Muzammal Naseer](https://muzammal-naseer.netlify.app/).
