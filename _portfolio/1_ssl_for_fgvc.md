title: "Self-Supervised Learning for Fine Grained Image Categorization"
excerpt: "The project studies the effectiveness of Self-supervised Learning for Fine-grained classification task. In
this work, we explore the usefulness of various pretext tasks, specifically, rotation, pretext invariant
representation learning (PIRL), and deconstruction and construction learning (DCL) for Fine-grained
classification. The technical report is available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08788). <br/><br/>
The figure below compares the Grad-CAM visualizations of the various auxiliary SSL tasks
with the baseline on an image of a crested auklet. The DCL successfully localizes the discriminative
features such as the birdâ€™s webbed feet and black claws <br/><br/>
