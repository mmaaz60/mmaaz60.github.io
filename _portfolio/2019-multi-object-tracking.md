title: "Multi Object Tracking"
excerpt: "Research on combining Siamese Trackers and recurrent neural networks (LSTM) to simultaneously exploit 
appearance and spatial information for multi-object tracking, developing unique approach for occlusion aware object 
tracking, and analyzing effectiveness of BEV space projections for spatial tracking. Code for the this project is 
available [here](https://github.com/kahnchana/lstm_tracker). An initial outline of the work done is present on arxiv 
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11651). <br/><br/>
