title: "Panoptic Segmentation"
excerpt: "Research on panoptic segmentation using conditional random fields. Worked on development of a novel information 
  fusion layer, for optimum combination of semantic and instance segmentation network outputs. Bipartite Conditional Random
  Fields (BCRF) uses an energy function containing cross-potential terms between the outputs of two parallel deep neural 
  network heads to produce an optimal panoptic segmentaion condition on the original image. The BCRF layer uses a cross 
  compatibility function between each pair of thing and stuff classes, which is completely learned using the data 
  distribution. Our work was able to achieving state-of-the-art performance on selected popular datasets. The novel 
  layer is also more interpretable and is inline with our intuition about compatibility between classes. Code for our
  work is hosted [here](https://github.com/sahan-liyanaarachchi/bcrf-detectron). Our BMVC publication and oral 
  presentation can be found [here](https://www.bmvc2020-conference.com/conference/papers/paper_0184.html). <br/><br/>
