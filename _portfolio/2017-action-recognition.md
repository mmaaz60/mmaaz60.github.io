title: "Action Recognition in Videos"
excerpt: "The project focused on researching on action recognition in videos. We explored individual contribution of static and 
motion domain information for action recognition and succeeded in establishing the presence of optimal contribution 
ratios. Using Cholesky transformations based control of correlation to parents of fused feature vectors, we managed to 
experimentally validate our findings. Additionally, we explored the role of underlying temporal trends of video 
sub-events in recognizing compound actions. Tasked with modelling that temporal trend, individually I experimented with 
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) considering their greater representation capacity, and established their optimality 
over traditional techniques for our use case of modelling temporally evolving feature vectors. This work resulted in 
two peer-reviewed publications at [DICTA 2017](/files/dicta-2017-paper.pdf) and [TCSVT 2019](/files/tcsvt-2019-paper.pdf). 
Code for the RNN component of this system is available [here](https://github.com/kahnchana/RNN). "
