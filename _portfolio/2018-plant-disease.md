title: "Automated Plant Leaf Disease Detection"
excerpt: "Designing a plant disease detection system aimed at helping small-scale cultivators and home 
gardeners. In collaboration with a plant virus indexing centre, we were able to tested our product closely with a 
number of selected cultivators. We focussed on utilizing multi-spectral image feeds (NIR/RGB spectra) and implementing 
transfer learning based training of CNNs on small datasets of domain-specific images. The product was deployed using a 
mobile app with edge inference and recognized as a Top Initiative at National Tech Awards. Initial versions of the 
product were also developed as a raspberry-pi based system and later an FPGA based system. Code for the raspberry-pi 
based system is hosted [here](https://github.com/kahnchana/Plant_Disease_Recognition). <br/><br/>
