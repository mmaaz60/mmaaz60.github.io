<div class="MsoNormal">A world so bright with colours so vivid,</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">And winds of scent that never stay placid,<br />To a world fresh filled with much delight,<br />A butterfly young begins its graceful flight. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The glorious, majestic, and glamorous sun,<br />He falls for none but that fierce one,<br />His wings do feel those scorching rays of hers,<br />But love is madness, one deceiving curse. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">And of course a wade through pools of moonlight,<br />Amidst the soothing air she brings with night,<br />Wash away those burns leaving little behind,<br />Yet unseen is the moon to his lost mind. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The butterfly too begins to roam in despair, <br />Soon amused by flowers, fleeting yet so fair,<br />The moon he misses, so soothing and kind,<br />But sheâ€™s no sun, he must leave both behind,<br />The flowers it is, he makes up his mind,<br />Drunk on their nectar he lives happy but blind.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div>
