Winds of morn ruffle all leaves around, <br/>
The nest awakes by that shuffling sound, <br/>
Spears of sunlight tear apart the green, <br/>
Endless skies around so much they mean. <br/>


Within that nest a struggle spans weeks, <br/>
The strength of flight a tiny birdling seeks, <br/>
Explore and wander all around in delight, <br/>
All to gain that mighty freedom of flight. <br/>


The world beyond and yonder it adores, <br/>
Again its little wings the birdling moves, <br/>
Always wondering of beyond the green, <br/>
Finally it flies to that wondrous realm. <br/>


Skies of freedom slowly begin to reveal, <br/>
Of fierce winds and dangers the clouds conceal, <br/>
It sees the lands that always drag one down, <br/>
The birdling makes one tiny little frown. <br/>


Rough winds and times both pass by, <br/>
A nest it builds up and high, <br/>
The wings no more amuse its mind, <br/>
The facade of freedom it leaves behind. <br/>


Another morn comes by so fresh and bright, <br/>
Brushing through the straw the rays of light, <br/>
Awake another birdling ready to begin its own fight, <br/>
Perched above the older bird smiles down at that familiar sight. <br/>
