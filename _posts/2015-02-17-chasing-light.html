<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #0c343d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Walking down one empty lonely lane,<br /> Smiling up at that desolate lovely dame, <br /> Who in all her pride and glamour, <br /> Glimmers from above oh magical stunner,<br /> Alone yet queen of heavens above,<br /> Make mine the moon forever I vow. <br /> <br /> But in that dark and lonely lane,<br /> Lies just misery and none to gain,<br /> The glimmer above sometimes adds light, <br /> Helps relieve and keep up that weary fight,<br /> Or so I think as I walk in the dark,<br /> Always that lane as gloomy do I mark. <br /> <br /> Through shadows of trees the fireflies' glint,<br /> Blinking at me but alas they are so faint,<br /> I smile at one ah the gorgeous creature,<br /> Flies to me but seems too miniature, <br /> Yet those giant trees sway in delight,<br /> Adorned in jewels those fireflies' light. <br /> <br /> The chill of night the strong winds bring,<br /> The leaves around a happy tune they sing,<br /> The lissom fields of paddy all dance along,<br /> Puppets of wind they swing to its song,<br /> Amused by all I begin to ponder in the darkness of night,<br /> Is it only the paddy that swings with the wind's might.</span></div>
