<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Early dawn watches one little girl from her cottage flee,<br />The morning birds chirping with her as she dances in glee,<br />Flowers every colour to that merry tune dance beside,<br />Flowers, flowers smiling to her she plucks in every stride.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span lang="EN-GB"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Little mind of faith unscrupulous,<br />Embrace all colours so fabulous,<br />Red and white and purple and blue,<br />With her flowers to the shrine she flew. <o:p></o:p></span><br /><span lang="EN-GB"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Old flowers forgotten she clears away,<br />But the old and wise to her they say,<br />“Only white flowers so noble and pure”,<br />The rest in her pocket she hides secure.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The little girl in stealth with a smile slowly steps inside,<br />A flower of each colour beneath the white she does hide,<br />The other coloured skinned flowers with her she takes outside,<br />With stretched arms those crushed flowers she lifts up to the skies,<br />As the winds devour those broken petals a little tear she cries.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div>
